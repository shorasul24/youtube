						A successful marketing plan relies heavily on the
						pulling-power of advertising copy. Writing
						result-oriented ad copy is difficult, as it must appeal
						to, entice, and convince consumers to take action. There
						is no magic formula to write perfect ad copy; it is
						based on a number of factors, including ad placement,
						demographic, even the consumerâ€™s mood when they see your
						ad.
